# rfw-gender-age
Enhanced Racial Faces in the Wild (RFW) dataset with added gender and age annotations for comprehensive demographic analysis in face recognition research.


The annotations are provided in a CSV file format for easy access and manipulation. Each entry in the file corresponds to an image in the RFW dataset and includes the following fields: Path (the relative path to the image file), Gender (the gender of the person in the image), Age (the age range of the person), id (the original ID of the person in the dataset), and Age Category (a numeric code representing the age group of the person). By providing these additional labels, we aim to enable researchers to explore intersectional bias across race, gender, and age in face recognition systems.
